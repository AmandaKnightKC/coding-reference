Welcome to my personal learning lab ‚Äî a curated collection of notes, setup guides, and mini-projects as I deepen my skills in Python, SQL, MySQL, WSL, and related tools.

This repo documents what I‚Äôm actively learning or referencing, including:

- Configuration setups
- Cheat sheets
- Practice scripts
- Environment troubleshooting
- Concept breakdowns

It‚Äôs not meant to be polished ‚Äî just practical.
