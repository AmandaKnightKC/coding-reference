## üå≥ `tree` Command Summary

| Command | Description | Example Output |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| `tree` | Shows full directory tree (all levels) | Lists all files/folders recursively |
| `tree -L 2` | Limits depth to 2 levels | Folders and files up to 2 levels deep |
| `tree -d` | Show directories only | Hides individual files |
| `tree -a` | Includes hidden files (e.g., `.git`) | Shows dotfiles |
| `tree > file.txt` | Save output to a file | Creates a flat `.txt` copy of the tree |
| `tree -L 2 \| sed "1s\|.\|$(basename $PWD)\|"` | Replaces the `.` with folder name at top | Makes the structure name more readable |
| `tree -L 2 -I '__pycache__'` | Ignores specific files/folders | Useful for excluding clutter |

> üí° Tip: Install with `sudo apt install tree` if it‚Äôs not already available in WSL.

``` tree -L 2 | sed "1s|\.|$(basename $PWD)|" > structure.txt ```

Breakdown:

- tree -L 2 generates your directory structure

- sed "1s|\.|$(basename $PWD)|":

- 1s: means ‚Äúsubstitute on line 1 only‚Äù

- | is used as a delimiter instead of /

- . matches the dot at the top of the tree output

- $(basename $PWD) gets your current folder name

## üõ†Ô∏è sed stands for stream editor ‚Äî it‚Äôs a Unix/Linux command-line tool used to

Search, find and replace, insert, or delete text

Process and transform text in files or input streams

It‚Äôs especially handy for making quick, automated edits without opening a text editor.
